# 1-Bit_Full_Adder-using-CMOS-Mirror-Logic
# Abstract
Adders are one of the main components of majority of circuits and find their application in ALUâ€™s, microprocessors, DSP processors. A 1-bit full adder using CMOS mirror logic is designed and implemented in this paper. The implementation will be done in 28nm technology node using Synopsys tools. The reference waveforms [Figure2] will be verified with actual waveforms obtained from simulation
